Projects for CS420 (Intro to Computer Graphics)

Project 1- Height Fields

Takes an input .jpg file and generates a 3D heightmap based on the color of each pixel. 
The model generated can be viewed as points, wireframes, or as a full model (with triangles).


Project 2- Rollercoaster simulator

Models a roller coaster specified by spline coordinates (.sp file) 
using Catmull Rom. The user is able to ride on the roller coaster in a simulated skybox and ground 
using texture mapping. 


Project 3- Ray Tracing 

Created a ray tracer that handles opaque surfaces with lighting and shadows. Created objects from data
specified in input file using ray tracing and used the Phong illumination model to create the appropriate
lighting for the environment.  
Examples can be found under src/000.jpg, 001.jpg, etc.
