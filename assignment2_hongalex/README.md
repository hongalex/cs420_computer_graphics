Assignment#2 README

1. Textures can be found in the hw2-starter-code/textures directory, one image for sky/ground

2. Currently I am using the goodRide.sp in track.txt

3. Up vectors are calculated using the method described in the assignment website, that is calculating normals and binormals

4. However, some parts of the ride may appear tilted due to the nature of the curve. I have confirmed with other students that 
	have had a similar issue.
	
5. You can press 'P' to move further in the roller coaster or 'O' to go back. At the end of the ride, the position will revert back 
	to the start of the ride
